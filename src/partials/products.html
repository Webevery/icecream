      <h4 class="product__name">ICE CREAM</h4>
      <p class="product__description">
        Ice cream is a sweetened frozen food typically eaten as a snack or
        dessert. It may be made from milk or cream and is flavoured with a
        sweetener, either sugar or an alternative, and a spice, such as cocoa or
        vanilla, or with fruit such as strawberries or peaches. It can also be
        made by whisking a flavored cream base and liquid nitrogen together.
        Food coloring is sometimes added, in addition to stabilizers. The
        mixture is cooled below the freezing point of water and stirred to
        incorporate air spaces and to prevent detectable ice crystals from
        forming.

      <h4 class="product__name">ICE COFFEE</h4>
      <p class="product__description">
        Iced coffee is a coffee beverage served cold. It may be prepared either
        by brewing coffee normally (i.e. carafe, French press, etc.) and then
        serving it over ice or in cold milk, or by brewing the coffee cold. In
        hot brewing, sweeteners and flavoring may be added before cooling, as
        they dissolve faster. Iced coffee can also be sweetened with
        pre-dissolved sugar in water.

      <h4 class="product__name">MILKSHAKES</h4>
      <p class="product__description">
        A milkshake (sometimes simply called a shake) is a sweet drink made by
        blending milk, ice cream, and flavorings or sweeteners such as
        butterscotch, caramel sauce, chocolate syrup, fruit syrup, or whole
        fruit into a thick, sweet, cold mixture. It may also be made using a
        base made from non-dairy products, including plant milks such as almond
        milk, coconut milk, or soy milk.
