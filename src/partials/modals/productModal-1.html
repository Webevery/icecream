      <p class="product__description">
        Ice cream is a sweetened frozen food typically eaten as a snack or
        dessert. It may be made from milk or cream and is flavoured with a
        sweetener, either sugar or an alternative, and a spice, such as cocoa or
        vanilla, or with fruit such as strawberries or peaches. It can also be
        made by whisking a flavored cream base and liquid nitrogen together.
        Food coloring is sometimes added, in addition to stabilizers. The
        mixture is cooled below the freezing point of water and stirred to
        incorporate air spaces and to prevent detectable ice crystals from
        forming.
