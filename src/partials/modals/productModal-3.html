      <p class="product__description">
        A milkshake (sometimes simply called a shake) is a sweet drink made by
        blending milk, ice cream, and flavorings or sweeteners such as
        butterscotch, caramel sauce, chocolate syrup, fruit syrup, or whole
        fruit into a thick, sweet, cold mixture. It may also be made using a
        base made from non-dairy products, including plant milks such as almond
        milk, coconut milk, or soy milk.
