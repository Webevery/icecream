      AH, COWS. These black and white, grass-eating beasts that go "moo" are
      some of the funniest (and most adorable) animals. Just look at them â€”their
      tongues are long enough to reach their noses! Whether you're a dairy eater
      or not, you have to admit that they're pretty amusing.
